- If the task needs more information of the scene, navigate wisely to the required targets (objects, places, or people). 
- Avoid repeated actions like useless forward motion and circling.
- You can only interact with objects or humans (e.g. pick/place/open/close/handover) if they are within your view and very close to you.
- You can only hold one object at a time. Put down any held object before picking up another.
- Tasks containing "I" or "me" are requested by a person in the scene.
- Reflect on why previous actions fail to avoid repeating mistakes and ajdust your current action.
- You have a limited number of {} steps to complete the task.
